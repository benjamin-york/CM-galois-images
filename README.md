This code is for the upcoming manuscript [*Models of CM elliptic curves with a prescribed l-adic Galois image*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04159) by Enrique Gonzàlez-Jimènez, Àlvaro Lozano-Robledo, and Benjamin York, arXiv:2408.04159 (2024).

This code is contained in two folders. The first folder, Image_Code, contains code verifying information about l-adic images of Galois as outlined in our paper.

The second folder, Division_Fields, verifies claims about certain division fields of CM elliptic curves made in the paper.

See the README section of each file for more detailed information.
