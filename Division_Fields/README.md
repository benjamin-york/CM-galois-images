The `Magma` code in this folder verifies claims made in our paper about division fields of elliptic curves with certain CM j-invariants.

`DivisionField_D-3` verifies the claims made in Prop. 3.12 of our paper for the 3- and 9-division fields of elliptic curves with CM discriminant -3 (j-invariant 0).

`DivisionField_D-8` verifies the claims made in Prop. 3.6 of our paper for the 2-, 4- and 8-division fields of elliptic curves with CM discriminant -8.

`DivisionField_D-16` verifies the claims made in Prop. 3.9 of our paper for the 2-, 4- and 8-division fields of elliptic curves with CM discriminant -16.
